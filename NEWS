v1.1.2                                                      (2018-01-06)

 * Support building on systems with undefined PATH_MAX, e.g. GNU Hurd.
   Simple, but not ideal solution yet - PATH_MAX is assumed to be 4096.

 * Stop assuming that LDFLAGS has flags only for the linker (LD).
   It used to be true long time ago, when these flags were passed
   directly to ld.  Nowadays (for quite many years already) it happens
   differently and ld is almost never called directly during build,
   because it's the compiler that is used for performing linking stage
   (so called CCLD, practically almost always the same as CC).

   The build process was already using CCLD (defaulting to CC's value),
   but was prefixing all unprefixed flags in LDFLAGS with -Wl, prefix,
   making it impossible to pass non-linker flags via LDFLAGS to CCLD.
   No more!  Now it's assumed that LDFLAGS are meant to be passed to
   the compiler, so linker flags require explicit -Wl, prefix.


v1.1.1a                                                     (2018-01-02)

 * Non-code-related change requested by debian package maintainer.
   Other distributions are unaffected by it.


v1.1.1                                                      (2017-12-04)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * BUGFIX: Reading metadata file with extended attributes entries led
           to corruption of metadata represented in memory on 64-bit
           platforms, so applying could led to corruption of metadata
           on disk too.  Bug discovered thanks to Uros Juvan.


v1.1.0                                                      (2016-02-01)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * BUGFIX: Applying metadata with extended attribute having null byte
           in value zeroed all following bytes of this xattr value.

 * BUGFIX: Reading extended attributes while not having permissions
           resulted in crash.

 * Empty directories not present in metadata can be now removed when
   applying stored metadata if -E / --remove-empty-dirs option is used.

 * Stored metadata (in .metadata file by default) and real metadata
   (from filesystem) can be now dumped in human-readable form using new
   action: -d / --dump.  Please do not rely on its current format!

 * Scripts in example/ directory do not require bash anymore and there
   is a new example for post checkout hook.

 * Dependency on libattr's xattr.h header has been removed.
   As long as your libc provides sys/xattr.h (glibc does it since v2.3),
   everything should be fine.

 * Dependency on libbsd has been added.  It's used by dump action.
